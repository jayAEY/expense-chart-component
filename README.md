## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to keep working with creating tooltips. They've always been a bit tricky for me.
I'd also like to try and make this app display all the spending info dynamically rather than just the day to day spending. Unfortunately, the provided json file didn't include any of that.
